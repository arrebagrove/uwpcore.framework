# UWPCore Framework for Windows 10 (Mobile) #

The UWPCore Framework is a development acceleration library for the Universal Windows Platform. It is a collection of best practices and reusable services to simplify the development for Windows 10 apps.

### Is the framework inspired by another one? ###

The framworks navigation system and application shell is maily inspired by [Template 10](https://github.com/Windows-XAML/Template10) by Jerry Nixon. The application shell has been further improved with swipe gestured inspired by [Justin Xin Liu](https://github.com/JustinXinLiu/SwipeableSplitView). From time to time, the UI of the shell has been updated to be more similar to Microsofts default apps, such as News, Weather, Sports or Groove-Music.
